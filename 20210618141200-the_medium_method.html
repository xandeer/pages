This simple method is meant as a starting point for merging paper and
digital into your workflow to capture all of the benefits of both.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This notebook is what I work out of during the day. It sits open on my desk
collecting everything. It’s a task collector, a scrapbook (daily comic
strips often find their way in), an event grabber, a notepad, a sketchbook,
a journal and a commonplace book (for gathering quotes and notes from what I
read, like and learn.) This is the notebook’s dedicated purpose.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
At the end of each day, I do a nightly transcription and review. This is
when I open my notebook and look at everything that I’ve collected from the
day, and begin to process it. I look for any future events and add them to
my online calendar. I look for all completed tasks on my daily post-it (more
on this in a bit) and mark them complete in Todoist. I also add any new
tasks from my notebook into Todoist, assigning all appropriate dates, notes
and tags. I then look into my online calendar to see what I have scheduled
for the next day, and I add those appointments to my post-it, followed by my
top three tasks from Todoist.

<h2 id="org73bda4f"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> A daily Post-It note</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Why a post-it? Simply put, I find post-its are the hardest to ignore. I
stick the day’s post-it to the next new page in my notebook and this forces
me to stare at it all day as I am writing. If something is incredibly urgent
I can stick the post-it to the screen of my computer or my phone or the
front door. When I leave my desk, it’s just as easy to grab that little neon
square and stick it inside of my pocket notebook. I also find that the
limited space of the post-it forces focus. The post-it requires me to be
aware of priority when making the list, and it allows me to see nothing but
those three tasks throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
Often, while working, we allow incoming tasks to deter us from our most
important daily goals. The Medium Method makes getting derailed more
difficult. It’s hard to squeeze another task onto my post-it. If I’m going
to squeeze a new task into my day, I have to really want to. Otherwise, if
the task doesn’t qualify, it goes into my main notebook for Todoist entry
later that evening.
</p>

<p>
The post-it also affords me the psychological satisfaction of crossing out a
completed task. If at the end of the day, I’ve completed all three tasks I
can crinkle the post-it up into a ball and shoot for the bin. If I’ve failed
to complete all three, I carry the post-it over to the next day. And trust
me, from experience, two post-it days suck and should be avoided at all
costs.

<h2 id="org561f419"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Long-term digital storage</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The last thing I do every day is copy all of my notes into OneNote (you can
just as easily use Evernote or Google Keep.) All notes on movies, books,
albums, etc. go into a notebook called “Commonplace.” This affords me the
ability to utilize quick search in the future when needing information. I
can also link notes to each other as I begin to see how new notes relate
with older notes.
</p>

<p>
In OneNote, I have another notebook called “Journal.” In this notebook, I
have sections for each month and in these sections are pages for each
day. Here, I copy every important event that occurs during the day. While
separated by day and month, I do not separate my journal pages by year. This
means, for example, that my Dec 4th page has notes from 2015, 2014, and any
other years for which I have notes.
</p>

<p>
When I copy the current notes into the journal each day, I can then be
reminded of what happened on this same day in the past. The most important
part of this process is that it allows me to search for past events. Past
events aren’t something that we think of often when creating productivity
systems, but wouldn’t it be useful to have access to this type of
information when we need it? Wouldn’t it be nice to know: What day was that
meeting? What was the name of that person that I met at the last networking
event? What did we talk about? What was that restaurant we went to in
Switzerland called? When did I buy my laptop? When does that warranty
expire?
</p>

<p>
I even find that this nightly review is useful for social media. Did I think
of anything short and funny today? Save that for Twitter tomorrow. Did I
make any doodles or sketches that I like? Save that for Instagram. What
concept from the book I’m reading stuck out as the most impactful? Save that
to discuss in my Snapchat story for the next day.
