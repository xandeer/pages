<li>Dr. Stephen Covey said, "<b>Live out of your imagination, not your history</b>."</li>
<li>Every person you meet, no matter how happy they appear on the outside, is
dealing with serious challenges in their life.</li>
<li>Who cares how long it takes?</li>
<li>Said R. Buckminster Fuller, *"You never change things by fighting the
existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the
existing model obsolete."*</li>
<li>"It's a terrible thing, I think, in life to wait until your're ready. I have
this feeling now that actually no one is ever ready to do anything. There is
almost no such thing as ready. There is only now. And you may as well do it
now. Now is as good a time as any." &#x2013; Hugh Laurie</li>
<li><b>It's powerful to stop pursuing final destinations and instead pursue
experiences and growth.</b></li>
<li>According to Gilovich's research, it's far more powerful to seek and invest
in experiences than it is to seek material possessions.</li>
<li><b>The anticipation of an event is usually far more emotionally powerful than
the event itself.</b></li>
<li>Living for something beyond yourself.</li>
<li>The most loving and deep relationships are built on a very simple
foundation: giving and gratitude.</li>
<li><p>
Write down <b>WHO</b> you want to work with.
</p>

<p>
Write down <b>WHY</b> you want to learn from and/or work with them.
</p></li>
<li><b>Treat others how you would love to be treated.</b></li>
<li>Self-made is an illusion. There are many people who played divine roles in
you having the life that you have today. Be sure to let them know how
grateful you are.</li>
<li>It's better to give the piece of pie on your plate to the right person and
you'll quickly get plates back with even bigger pieces.</li>
<li><b>Relationships are the most important currency in the world.</b></li>
<li>The pie doesn't belong to them, but to the Universe.</li>
<li>"Good timber does not grow with ease: The stronger wind, ther stronger
trees; The further sky, the greater length; The more the storm, the more the
strength. By sun and cold, by rain and snow, In trees and men good timbers
grow." &#x2013; Douglas Malloch</li>
<li>"<b>Expect everything and attach to nothing.</b>" &#x2013; Carrie Campbell</li>
<li><p>
Nothing happens until after you commit.
</p>

<p>
Nothing happens until after the ships are burned.
</p>

<p>
<b>Once you've passed your point of no return, you've fully bought into your
own vision. You're committed. Your role, and thus identity, change. You've
removed alternatives that were nothing more than distractions anyways.
You've forced your own hand and now must move in the direction you want to
go. You're all in.</b>
</p></li>
<li>The benefits of gratitude are endless. But more than anything, gratitude
helps you realize the abundance of all around you. What you focus on
expands. When you focus on abundance, you invite an endless stream of it
into your life.</li>
<li>"When you change the way you see things, the things you see change." &#x2013; Dr.
Wayne Dyer</li>
<li>"There is an ocean of abundance and one can tap into it with a teaspoon, a
bucket, or a tractor trailer. The ocean doesn't care." &#x2013; The One Minute
Millionaire</li>
<li>Focus more on <b>WHO</b> and <b>HOW</b>. When you focus on <b>WHO</b>, you allow yourself
to think much bigger.</li>
<li>*"Writing organizes and clarifies our thoughts. Writing is how we think our
way into a subject and make it our own. Writing enables us to find out what
we know &#x2013; and what we don't know &#x2013; about whatever we're trying to learn."*
&#x2013; William Zinsser</li>
<li>"Willpower is for people who are still uncertain about what they want to
do." &#x2013; Helia</li>
<li>If you don't start right, you decrease your motivation and confidence
throughout the day, which leads to increasingly impulsive and negative
decision-making. It's a vicious cycle.</li>
<li><p>
As Leonardo Dicaprio has said, "Every next level of your life will require a
different you."
</p>

<p>
Similarly, Marshall Goldsmith said, "What got you here won't get you there."
</p></li>
<li><p>
How much fire do you currently have to pursue something powerful?
</p>

<p>
How much fire are you lighting in others?
</p></li>
<li><b>Pay attention to what your mind tells you. Write it down. Then keeping
acting in an upward cycle.</b></li>
<li>Money fades with time. But the things you create have the power to endure.
For example, great works of art continue to impact and influence long after
the creators of those works has passed on.</li>
<li>According to Dr. Marshall Goldsmith, "If you do not create and control your
environment, your environment creates and controls you."</li>
<li>"Art is a personal act of courage, something one human does that creates
change in another." &#x2013; Seth Godin</li>
<li>According to Stanford Psychologist, BJ Fogg, "Formating habits is not about
willpower&#x2026; it's about design and revision."</li>
<li>Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.</li>
<li><p>
<i>Achievement goals</i> are all about getting a certain outcome. They are
extrinsically motivated.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mastery goals</i> are all about what you learn and become. They are
intrinsically motivated.
</p></li>
<li>If you had 6 months left to live, would it be difficult to wake up at 5AM?</li>
<li>If you don't have a guiding purpose, you'll be aimless with your time.</li>
<li>When was the last time you got on the internet for a specific purpose, and
then got off when that purpose was complete?</li>
<li><p>
If you don't know you have a problem, it probably won't change.
</p>

<p>
If you don't believe you have a problem, it probably won't change.
</p>

<p>
If you can't admit you have a problem, you're living in denial.
</p></li>
<li>The greatest dreams are always unrealistic.</li>
<li>Everything popular is wrong.</li>
<li>How you do anything is how you do everything.</li>
<li>The way to measure your progress is backward against where you start, not
against your ideal.</li>
