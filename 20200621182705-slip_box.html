The Zettelkasten method of note-taking is designed to increase research
productivity: in particular, it acts as a research partner, where
conversations with it may produce new and surprising lines of thought. This
method is attributed to German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who using the
method had produced volumes of written works.

<p>
In its paper form, the slip-box is simply a box of cards. These cards are
small – often only large enough to fit a single concept. The size limitation
encourages ideas to be broken down into individual concepts. These ideas are
explicitly linked together. The breakdown of ideas encourages tangential
exploration of ideas, increasing the surface for thought. Making linking
explicit between notes also encourages one to think about the connections
between concepts.
