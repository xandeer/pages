And deliberate practice is demanding; it requires effort. Trying to skip
this step would be like going to the gym and trying to work out with the
least effort possible. That just doesn't make sense, just like it wouldn't
make sense to hire a coach to do the heavy lifting. <b>A coach is not there to
do the work, but to show us how to use our time and effort in the most
effective way.</b> What is self-evident in sports we are only starting to
realise is true for learning as well. "The one who does the work does the
learning," writes Doyle (2008, 63).

<b>When we try to answer a question before we know how to, we will later
remember the answer better, even if our attempt failed.</b>

If learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act.

Elaboration means nothing other than really <a href="20200729091540-thinking.html#ID-EF861195-938E-40E0-BCEE-739FA4398539">Thinking</a> about the meaning of
what we read, how it could inform different questions and topics and how it
could be combined with other knowledge.
</p>

<p>
In fact, "<a href="20200725160657-行文.html#ID-38D8E3B5-8907-4BF0-84D2-E7DA9C46B9C8">Writing</a> for <a href="20200621182624-learning.html#ID-3B5BACD4-DDE4-4727-A648-A4BC45466CE9">Learning</a>" is the name of an "elaboration method".

Luhmann almost never read a text twice (Hagen 1997) and was still regarded
as an impressive conversation partner who seemed to have all information
ready to hand.

<p>
Not learning from what we read because we don't take the time to elaborate
on it is the real waste of time.

There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the <a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html#ID-D43B97E9-30A7-47BA-8DDE-E9FEC5FD78D3">slip-box</a>: The
slip-box takes care of details and references and is a Long-term Memory
resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain
to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and
frees it up to be creative. Both the brain and the slip-box can focus on
what they are best at.
