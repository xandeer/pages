They can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance.

<p>
Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or
nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be
constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.
</p>

<p>
<a href="20201102101511-lisp.html">Lisp</a> was invented in the late 1950s as a formalism for reasoning about the
use of certain kinds of logical expressions, called <i>recursion equations</i>, as
a model for computation.
</p>

<p>
If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the framework
for our discussion of programming? Because the language possesses unique
features that make it an excellent medium for studying important programming
constructs and data structures and for relating them to the linguistic
features that support them. The most significant of these features is the
fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called <i>procedures</i>, can themselves
be represented and manipulated as Lisp data. The importance of this is that
there are powerful program-design techniques that rely on the ability to
blur the traditional distinction between "passive" data and "active"
processes. As we shall discover, Lisp's flexibility in <b>handling procedures
as data</b> makes it one of the most convenient languages in existence for
exploring these techniques. The ability to represent procedures as data also
makes Lisp an excellent language for writing programs that must manipulate
other programs as data, such as the interpreters and compilers that support
computer languages.
</p>

<p>
Every powerful language has three mechanisms:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>primitive expressions</b>, which represent the simplest entities the language
is concerned with</li>
<li><b>means of combination</b>, by which compound elements are built from simpler
ones</li>
<li><b>means of abstraction</b>, by which compound elements can be named and
manipulated as units</li>
</ol>
