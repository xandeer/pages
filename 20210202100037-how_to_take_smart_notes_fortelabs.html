<h1 class="title">How to Take Smart Notes / fortelabs</h1>
<p>
I long ago stopped reading books on note-taking.
</p>

<p>
They were always too vague and boring, full of platitudes that had little to
do with the world outside academia.
</p>

<p>
I especially avoided “how-to” style books on the subject.
</p>

<p>
They would often list dozens of tips and tricks that had little to do with
each other. There was never an overarching system for turning notes into
concrete results.
</p>

<p>
But recently I picked up How To Take Smart Notes (affiliate link) by Sönke
Ahrens. Ahrens is a Lecturer in Philosophy of Education at the University of
Duisburg-Essen and also coaches students, academics, and professionals with
a focus on time management, decision-making, and personal growth.
</p>

<p>
It is by far the most impactful and profound book I’ve ever read on the
subject. I was astounded to encounter in its pages (with uncanny similarity)
many of the same principles I had discovered over 10 years of personal
experience.
</p>

<p>
This book is so full of insights that it broke my usual approach to
summarizing books.
</p>

<p>
My approach is based on the assumption that most books are a few morsels of
real insight wrapped in layers and layers of fluff. As I read, I
systematically unravel those layers of fluff and extract only those
insights, like a chemist distilling only the purest compound.
</p>

<p>
But this book is not written in the usual way. It is written using an
external thinking system, which I call a Second Brain.
</p>

<p>
The evidence is clear: Instead of squeezing as many pages as possible out of
one idea, How To Take Smart Notes squeezes as many ideas as possible onto
every page. Every paragraph has a point, and I struggled to leave anything
out of this summary.
</p>

<p>
By identifying the principles that stand the test of time despite huge
changes in the underlying technology, we can better understand the essential
nature of the creative process. We can focus our efforts on mastering the
art of creative note-taking, producing more insightful writing, and
fulfilling our full potential.
</p>

<p>
In this article, I’ll summarize the 10 most important principles for taking
“smart” notes according to Ahrens. You can also find a detailed,
step-by-step description of the method at the end.  What the book is about
</p>

<p>
How To Take Smart Notes is a book on note-taking for students, academics,
and non-fiction writers.
</p>

<p>
It promises to help readers adopt “a reliable and simple external structure
to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains.” By adopting
such a system, Ahrens promises that we will be able to “efficiently turn our
thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a
treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way.”
</p>

<p>
While producing published written works is the end goal, is it not the only
goal. Ahrens argues convincingly that turning one’s thoughts into writing
isn’t just useful for writers but for anyone who wants to improve their
thinking and learning in general.
</p>

<p>
By focusing on writing, Ahrens is able to speak in concrete terms about a
specific creative process while simultaneously drawing universal
conclusions. Instead of notes becoming a “graveyard for thoughts,” they can
become a life-long pool of rich and interconnected ideas we can draw on no
matter where our interests lead us.  Luhmann’s slip-box
</p>

<p>
Ahrens’ approach to note-taking was inspired by the 20th-century German
sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998). Luhmann was a prolific note-taker,
writer, and academic. Early in his academic career, Luhmann realized that a
note was only as valuable as its context – its network of associations,
relationships, and connections to other information.  Niklas Luhmann
</p>

<p>
He developed a simple system based on paper index cards, which he called his
“slip-box” (or zettelkasten in German). It was designed to connect any given
note to as many different potentially relevant contexts as possible.
</p>

<p>
Luhmann rejected alphabetical categorization of his notes, along with fixed
categories like the Dewey Decimal System. He intended his notes not just for
a single project or book but for a lifetime of reading and researching. He
designed his slip-box as a research database made up of index cards (zettel)
that were “thematically unlimited” and could be infinitely extended in any
direction.
</p>

<p>
One of the 90,000 index cards Luhmann created over his 30-year career, on
Gleichheit (“equality”). Note the red number in the bottom-left corner
indicating a branching topic. You can view a full archive of Luhmann’s notes
in an online database maintained by the University of Bielefeld. [Source:
Marvin Blum] Although it appeared to be just a simple filing system made up
of index cards, Luhmann’s slip-box grew to become an equal thinking partner
in his work. He described his system as his secondary memory
(zweitgedächtnis), alter ego, or reading memory (lesegedächtnis). He
reported that it continuously surprised him with ideas he’d forgotten he
had. Because of this, he claimed that there was actual communication going
on between himself and his zettelkasten. As he built up his collection of
notes, he embarked on a series of achievements that would eventually make
him one of the most influential sociologists and scientists of the 20th
century.
</p>

<p>
A picture of the very first notecard Luhmann added to his slip-box, labeled
with a number 1 in the top-left corner. It begins “1 Introduction; It must
be attempted to explain the criteria and concepts as clearly as is possible
so that their inadequacy and imperfection becomes clear.” [Source: Taking
Note blog] Here’s how it worked:
</p>

<p>
Luhmann wrote down interesting or potentially useful ideas he
encountered in his reading on uniformly sized index cards He wrote only
on one side of each card to eliminate the need to flip them over, and he
limited himself to one idea per card so they could be referenced
individually Each new index card received a sequential number, starting
at 1. When a new source was added to that topic, or he found something
to supplement it, he would add new index cards with letters as suffixes
(1a, 1b, 1c, etc.)  These branching connections were marked in red as
close as possible to the point where the branch began Any of these
branches could also have their own branches. The card for fellow German
sociologist Jürgen Habermas, for example, was labeled 21/3d26g53 As he
read, he would create new cards, update or add comments to existing
ones, create new branches from existing cards, and create new links
between cards on different “strands”
</p>

<p>
This diagram shows how subtopics branched off from main topics:
</p>

<p>

existing ones and receiving a letter designation [Source: Zettelkasten Blog]
Not only did this create a system that could extend infinitely in any
direction, but it also gave each index card a permanent ID number. This
number could be referenced from any other card, because it would never
change. The branches created “strands” of thought that one could enter at
any point, following it downstream to be elaborated upon or upstream to its
source.
</p>

<p>
It also led to a meaningful topography within the system: Topics that had
been extensively explored had long reference numbers, making their length
informative on its own. There is no hierarchy in the zettelkasten, which
means it can grow internally without any preconceived scheme. By creating
notes as a decentralized network instead of a hierarchical tree, Luhmann
anticipated hypertext and URLs.
</p>

<p>
Over his 30-year career, Luhmann published 58 books and hundreds of articles
on the way to completing his two-volume masterwork, The Society of Society
(1997). It presented a radical new theory that not only changed sociology
but also provoked heated discussions in philosophy, education, political
theory, and psychology.
</p>

<p>
For years, the importance of Luhmann’s slip-box was underestimated. As early
as 1985, he would regularly point to it as the source of his amazing
productivity: “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens
mainly within the slip-box” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987,
142). Until recently, no one believed that such a simple system could
produce such prolific output. We are so used to the idea that great outcomes
require great (and complicated) efforts.
</p>

<p>
But Luhmann often remarked that he never forced himself to do anything he
didn’t feel like doing: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I
immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter
aside and do something else” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f).
</p>

<p>
Wouldn’t it make sense that such output over so many years would be possible
because it was simple and easy, not in spite of it? Upon his death,
Luhmann’s slip-box contained 90,000 notes. This may seem like a staggering
number until you realize that it amounts to only six notes per day.
</p>

<p>
Let’s look deeper at the main principles that Luhmann used in his work,
which Ahrens has adapted to the modern age. The explosion of technology and
connectivity has inundated us with an overabundance of information. These
principles go a long way toward reestablishing the boundaries and
constraints that creativity needs to thrive.

Articles right away as a thank you

<p>
Principle #1: Writing is not the outcome of thinking; it is the medium in
which thinking takes place
</p>

<p>
Writing doesn’t begin when we sit down to put one paragraph after another on
the screen or page. It begins much, much earlier, as we take notes on the
articles or books we read, the podcasts or audiobooks we listen to, and the
interesting conversations and life experiences we have.
</p>

<p>
These notes build up as a byproduct of the reading we’re already doing
anyway. Even if you don’t aim to develop a grand theory, you need a way to
organize your thoughts and keep track of the information you consume.
</p>

<p>
If you want to learn and remember something long-term, you have to write it
down. If you want to understand an idea, you have to translate it into your
own words. If we have to do this writing anyway, why not use it to build up
resources for future publications?
</p>

<p>
Writing is not only for proclaiming fully formed opinions, but for
developing opinions worth sharing in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Writing works well in improving one’s thinking because it forces you to
engage with what you’re reading on a deeper level. Just because you read
more doesn’t automatically mean you have more or better ideas. It’s Iike
learning to swim – you have to learn by doing it, not by merely reading
about it.
</p>

<p>
The challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much to
learn, but to understand, as you will already have learned what you
understand. When you truly understand something, it is anchored to a
latticework of related ideas and meanings, which makes it far easier to
remember.
</p>

<p>
For example, you could memorize the fact that arteries are red and veins are
blue. But it is only when you understand why – that arteries carry
oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body, while veins carry
blood low in oxygen back to the heart – that that fact has any value. And
once we make this meaningful connection between ideas, it’s hard not to
remember it.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious. It
requires elaboration – we need to copy, translate, re-write, compare,
contrast, and describe a new idea in our own terms. We have to view the idea
from multiple perspectives and answer questions such as “How does this fact
fit with others I already know?” and “How can this phenomenon be explained
by that theory?” or “How does this argument compare to that one?”
</p>

<p>
Completing these tasks is exceedingly difficult inside the confines of our
heads. We need an external medium in which to perform this elaboration, and
writing is the most effective and convenient one ever invented.  Principle
#2: Do your work as if writing is the only thing that matters
</p>

<p>
The second principle extends the previous one even further: Do you work as
if writing is the only thing that matters.
</p>

<p>
In academia and science, virtually all research is aimed at eventual
publication Ahrens notes that “there is no such thing as private knowledge
in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.”
</p>

<p>
The purpose of research is to produce public knowledge that can be
scrutinized and tested. For that to happen, it has to be written down. And
once it is, what the author meant doesn’t matter – only the actual words
written on the page matter.
</p>

<p>
This principle requires us to expand our definition of “publication” beyond
the usual narrow sense. Few people will ever publish their work in an
academic journal or even on a blog. But everything that we write down and
share with someone else counts: notes we share with a friend, homework we
submit to a professor, emails we write to our colleagues, and presentations
we deliver to clients all count as knowledge made public.
</p>

<p>
This might still seem like a radical principle. Should we publicize even the
ideas we’ve only just encountered, or opinions half-formed, or wild theories
we can’t substantiate? Do we really need even more people broadcasting
half-baked opinions and theories online?
</p>

<p>
But the important part is the principle: Work as if writing is the only
thing that matters. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you consume
information completely changes the way you engage with it. You’ll be more
focused, more curious, more rigorous, and more demanding. You won’t waste
time writing down every detail, trying to make a perfect record of
everything that was said. Instead, you’ll try to learn the basics as
efficiently as possible so you can get to the point where open questions
arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about.
</p>

<p>
Almost every aspect of your life will change when you live as if you are
working toward publication. You’ll read differently, becoming more focused
on the parts most relevant to the argument you’re building. You’ll ask
sharper questions, no longer satisfied with vague explanations or leaps in
logic. You’ll naturally seek venues to present your work, since the feedback
you receive will propel your thinking forward like nothing else. You’ll
begin to act more deliberately, thinking several steps beyond what you’re
reading to consider its implications and potential.
</p>

<p>
Deliberate practice is the best way to get better at anything, and in this
case, you are deliberately practicing the most fundamental skill of all:
thinking. Even if you never actually publish one line of writing, you will
vastly improve every aspect of your thinking when you do everything as if
nothing counts except writing.  Principle #3: Nobody ever starts from
scratch
</p>

<p>
One of the most damaging myths about creativity is that it starts from
nothing. The blank page, the white canvas, the empty dance floor: Our most
romantic and universal artistic motifs seem to suggest that “starting from
scratch” is the essence of creativity.
</p>

<p>
This belief is reinforced by how writing is typically taught: We are told to
“pick a topic” as a necessary first step, then to conduct research, discuss
and analyze it, and finally come to a conclusion.
</p>

<p>
But how can you decide on an interesting topic before you’ve read about it?
You have to immerse yourself in research before you even know how to
formulate a good question. And the decision to read about one subject versus
another also doesn’t appear out of thin air. It usually comes from an
existing interest or understanding. The truth is every intellectual endeavor
starts with a preceding conception.
</p>

<p>
This is the tension at the heart of the creative process: You have to
research before you pick what you will write about. Ideally, you should
start researching long before, so you have weeks and months and even years
of rich material to work with as soon as you decide on a topic. This is why
an external system to record your research is so critical. It doesn’t just
enhance your writing process; it makes it possible.
</p>

<p>
And all this pre-research also involves writing. We build up an ever-growing
pool of externalized thoughts as we read. When the time comes to produce, we
aren’t following a blindly invented plan plucked from our unreliable
brains. We look in our notes and follow our interests, curiosity, and
intuition, which are informed by the actual work of reading, thinking,
discussing, and taking notes. We never again have to face that blank screen
with the impossible demand of “thinking of something to write about.”
</p>

<p>
No one ever really starts from scratch. Anything they come up with has to
come from prior experience, research, or other understanding. But because
they haven’t acted on this fact, they can’t track ideas back to their
origins. They have neither supporting material nor accurate sources. Since
they haven’t been taking notes from the start, they either have to start
with something completely new (which is risky) or retrace their steps (which
is boring).
</p>

<p>
It’s no wonder that nearly every guide to writing begins with
“brainstorming.” If you don’t have notes, you have no other option. But this
is a bit like a financial advisor telling a 65-year-old to start saving for
retirement – too little, too late.
</p>

<p>
Taking notes allows you to break free from the traditional, linear path of
writing. It allows you to systematically extract information from linear
sources, mix and shake them up together until new patterns emerge, and then
turn them back into linear texts for others to consume.
</p>

<p>
You’ll know you’ve succeeded in making this shift when the problem of not
having enough to write about is replaced by the problem of having far too
much to write about. When you finally arrive at the decision of what to
write about, you’ll already have made that decision again and again at every
single step along the way.  Principle #4: Our tools and techniques are only
as valuable as the workflow
</p>

<p>
Just because writing is not a linear process doesn’t mean we should go about
it haphazardly. We need a workflow – a repeatable process for collecting,
organizing, and sharing ideas.
</p>

<p>
Writing is often taught as a collection of “tips and tricks” – brainstorm
ideas, make an outline, use a three-paragraph structure, repeat the main
points, use vivid examples, set a timer. Each one in isolation might make
sense, but without the holistic perspective of how they fit together, they
add more work than they save. Every additional technique becomes its own
project without bringing the whole much further forward. Before long, the
whole mess of techniques falls apart under its own weight.
</p>

<p>
It is only when all the work becomes part of an integrated process that it
becomes more than the sum of its parts. Even the best techniques won’t make
a difference if they are used in conflicting ways. This is why the slip-box
isn’t yet another technique. It is the system in which all the techniques
are linked together.
</p>

<p>
Good systems don’t add options and features; they strip away complexity and
distractions from the main work, which is thinking. An undistracted brain
and a reliable collection of notes is pretty much all we need. Everything
else is just clutter.  Principle #5: Standardization enables creativity
</p>

<p>
Ahrens uses the excellent analogy of how the invention of shipping
containers revolutionized international trade to demonstrate the role of
note-taking in modern writing
</p>

<p>
Container shipping is a simple idea: ship products in standardized
containers instead of loading them onto ships haphazardly as had always been
done. But it took multiple failed attempts before it was successful, because
it wasn’t actually about the container, which after all is just a box.
</p>

<p>
The potential of the shipping container was only unleashed when every other
part of the shipping supply chain was changed to accommodate it. From
manufacturing to packaging to final delivery, the design of ships, cranes,
trucks, and harbors all had to align around moving containers as quickly and
efficiently as possible. Once they did, international shipping exploded,
setting the stage for Asia to become an economic power among many other
historic changes.
</p>

<p>
Many people still take notes, if at all, in an ad-hoc, random way. If they
see a nice sentence, they underline it. If they want to make a comment, they
write it in the margins. If they have a good idea, they write it in
whichever notebook is close at hand. And if an article seems important
enough, they might make the effort to save an excerpt. This leaves them with
many different kinds of notes in many different places and formats. This
means when it comes time to write, they first have to undertake a massive
project to collect and organize all these scattered notes.
</p>

<p>
Notes are like shipping containers for ideas. Instead of inventing a new way
to take notes for every source you read, use a completely standardized and
predictable format every time. It doesn’t matter what the notes contain,
which topic they relate to, or what medium they arrived through – you treat
each and every note exactly the same way.
</p>

<p>
It is this standardization of notes that enables a critical mass to build up
in one place. Without a standard format, the larger the collection grows,
the more time and energy have to be spent navigating the ever-growing
inconsistencies between them. A common format removes unnecessary complexity
and takes the second-guessing out of the process. Like LEGOs, standardized
notes can easily be shuffled around and assembled into endless
configurations without losing sight of what they contain.
</p>

<p>
The same principle applies to the steps of processing our notes. Consider
that no single step in the process of turning raw ideas into finished pieces
of writing is particularly difficult. It isn’t very hard to write down notes
in the first place. Nor is turning a group of notes into an outline very
demanding. It also isn’t much of a challenge to turn a working outline full
of relevant arguments into a rough draft. And polishing a well-conceived
rough draft into a final draft is trivial.
</p>

<p>
So if each individual step is so easy, why do we find the overall experience
of writing so grueling? Because we try to do all the steps at once. Each of
the activities that make up “writing” – reading, reflecting, having ideas,
making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words,
structuring, organizing, editing, correcting, and rewriting – require a very
different kind of attention.
</p>

<p>
Proofreading requires very focused, detail-oriented attention, while
choosing which words to put down in the first place might require a more
open, free-floating attention. When looking for interesting connections
between notes, we often need to be in a playful, curious state of mind,
whereas when putting them in logical order, our state of mind probably needs
to be more serious and precise.
</p>

<p>
The slip-box is the host of the process outlined above. It provides a place
where distinct batches of work can be created, worked on, and saved
permanently until the next time we are ready to deploy that particular kind
of attention. It deliberately puts distance between ourselves and what we’ve
written, which is essential for evaluating it objectively. It is far easier
to switch between the role of creator and critic when there is a clear
separation between them, and you don’t have to do both at the same time.
</p>

<p>
By standardizing and streamlining both the format of our notes and the steps
by which we process them, the real work can come to the forefront: thinking,
reflecting, writing, discussing, testing, and sharing. This is the work that
adds value, and now we have the time to do it more effectively.  Principle
#6: Our work only gets better when exposed to high-quality feedback
</p>

<p>
A workflow is similar to a chemical reaction: It can feed on itself,
becoming a virtuous cycle where the positive experience of understanding a
text motivates us to take on the next task, which helps us get better at
what we’re doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy our
work, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Nothing motivates us more than becoming better at what we do. And we can
only become better when we intentionally expose our work to high-quality
feedback.
</p>

<p>
There are many forms of feedback, both internal and external – from peers,
from teachers, from social media, and from rereading our own writing. But
notes are the only kind of feedback that is available anytime you need
it. It is the only way to deliberately practice your thinking and
communication skills multiple times per day.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to think we understand a concept until we try to put it in our
own words. Each time we try, we practice the core skill of insight:
distinguishing the bits that truly matter from those that don’t. The better
we become at it, the more efficient and enjoyable our reading becomes.
</p>

<p>
Feedback also helps us adjust our expectations and predictions about how
much we can get done in an hour or a day. Instead of sitting down to the
amorphous task of “writing,” we dedicate each working session to concrete
tasks that can be finished in a reasonable timeframe: Write three notes,
review two paragraphs, check five sources for an essay, etc. At the end of
the day, we know exactly how much we accomplished (or didn’t accomplish) and
can adjust our future expectations accordingly.  Principle #7: Work on
multiple, simultaneous projects
</p>

<p>
It is only when you have multiple, simultaneous projects and interests that
the full potential of an external thinking system is realized.
</p>

<p>
Think of the last time you read a book. Perhaps you read it for a certain
purpose – to gain some familiarity with a topic you’re interested in or find
insights for a project you’re working on. What are the chances that the book
contains only the precise insights you were looking for, and no others?
Extremely low it would seem. We encounter a constant stream of new ideas,
but only a tiny fraction of them will be useful and relevant to us at any
given moment.
</p>

<p>
Since the only way to find out which insights a book contains is to read it,
you might as well read and take notes productively. Spending a little extra
time to record the best ideas you encounter – whether or not you know how
they will ultimately be used – vastly increases the chances that you will
“stumble upon” them in the future.
</p>

<p>
The ability to increase the chances of such future accidental encounters is
a powerful one, because the best ideas are usually ones we haven’t
anticipated. The most interesting topics are the ones we didn’t plan on
learning about. But we can anticipate that fact and set our future selves up
for a high probability of productive “accidents.”  Principle #8: Organize
your notes by context, not by topic
</p>

<p>
Now that you’ve been collecting notes on your reading, how should you
organize them?
</p>

<p>
The classic mistake is to organize them into ever more specific topics and
subtopics. This makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes
overwhelming. The more notes pile up, the smaller and narrower the subtopics
become, limiting your ability to see meaningful connections between
them. With this approach, the greater one’s collection of notes, the less
accessible and useful they become.
</p>

<p>
Instead of organizing by topic and subtopic, it is much more effective to
organize by context. Specifically, the context in which it will be used. The
primary question when deciding where to put something becomes “In which
context will I want to stumble upon this again?”
</p>

<p>
In other words, instead of filing things away according to where they came
from, you file them according to where they’re going. This is the essential
difference between organizing like a librarian and organizing like a writer.
</p>

<p>
A librarian asks “Where should I store this note?” Their goal is to maintain
a taxonomy of knowledge that is accessible to everyone, which means they
have to use only the most obvious categories. They might file notes on a
psychology paper under “misjudgments,” “experimental psychology,” or
“experiments.”
</p>

<p>
That works fine for a library, but not for a writer. No pile of notes filed
uniformly under “psychology” will be easy to turn into a paper. There is no
variation or disagreement from which an interesting argument could arise.
</p>

<p>
A writer asks “In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this
note?” They will file it under a paper they are writing, a conference they
are speaking at, or an ongoing collaboration with a colleague. These are
concrete, near-term deliverables and not abstract categories.
</p>

<p>
Organizing by context does take a little bit of thought. The answer isn’t
always immediately obvious. A book about personal finance might interest me
for completely different reasons if I am a politician working on a campaign
speech, a financial advisor trying to help a client, or an economist
developing monetary policy. If I encounter a novel engineering method, it
may be useful for completely different reasons depending on whether I am
working on an engineering textbook, a skyscraper, or a rocket booster.
</p>

<p>
Writers don’t think about a single, “correct” location for a piece of
information. They deal in “scraps” which can often be repurposed and reused
elsewhere. The discarded byproducts from one piece of writing may become the
essential pillars of the next one. The slip-box is a thinking tool, not an
encyclopedia, so completeness is not important. The only gaps we do need to
be concerned about are the gaps in the final manuscript we are working
toward.
</p>

<p>
By saving all the byproducts of our writing, we collect all the future
material we might need in one place. This approach sets up your future self
with everything they need to work as decisively and efficiently as
possible. They won’t need to trawl through folder after folder looking for
all the sources they need. You’ll already have done that work for them.
Principle #9: Always follow the most interesting path
</p>

<p>
Ahrens notes that in most cases, students fail not because of a lack of
ability, but because they lose a personal connection to what they are
learning:
</p>

<p>
“When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most
often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to
learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal
goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies
autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan 2006; Reeve 2009).”
</p>

<p>
This is why we must spend as much time as possible working on things we find
interesting. It is not an indulgence. It is an essential part of making our
work sustainable and thus successful.
</p>

<p>
This advice runs counter to the typical approach to planning we are
taught. We are told to “make a plan” upfront and in detail. Success is then
measured by how closely we stick to this plan. Our changing interests and
motivations are to be ignored or suppressed if they interfere with the plan.
</p>

<p>
The history of science is full of stories of accidental discoveries. Ahrens
gives the example of the team that discovered the structure of DNA. It
started with a grant, but not a grant to study DNA. They were awarded funds
to find a treatment for cancer. As they worked, the team followed their
intuition and interest, developing the actual research program along the way
(Rheinberger 1997). If they had stuck religiously to their original plan,
they probably wouldn’t have discovered a cure for cancer and certainly
wouldn’t have discovered the structure of DNA.
</p>

<p>
Plans are meant to help us feel in control. But it is much more important to
actually be in control, which means being able to steer our work towards
what we consider interesting and relevant. According to a 2006 study by
psychology professor Arlen Moller, “When people experienced a sense of
autonomy with regard to the choice [of what to work on], their energy for
subsequent tasks was not diminished” (Moller 2006, 1034). In other words,
when we have a choice about what to work on and when, it doesn’t take as
much willpower to do it.
</p>

<p>
Our sense of motivation depends on making consistent forward progress. But
in creative work, questions change and new directions emerge. That is the
nature of insight. So we don’t want to work according to a rigid workflow
that is threatened by the unexpected. We need to be able to make small,
constant adjustments to keep our interest, motivation, and work aligned.
</p>

<p>
By breaking down the work of writing into discrete steps, getting quick
feedback on each one, and always following the path that promises the most
insight, unexpected insights can become the driving force of our work.
</p>

<p>
Luhmann never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to
him: “When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else.” As
in martial arts, if you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you
should not push against it but instead redirect it towards another
productive goal.  Principle #10: Save contradictory ideas
</p>

<p>
Working with a slip-box naturally leads us to save ideas that are
contradictory or paradoxical.
</p>

<p>
It’s much easier to develop an argument from a lively discussion of pros and
cons rather than a litany of one-sided arguments and perfectly fitting
quotes.
</p>

<p>
Our only criterion for what to save is whether it connects to existing ideas
and adds to the discussion. When we focus on open connections, disconfirming
or contradictory data suddenly becomes very valuable. It often raises new
questions and opens new paths of inquiry. The experience of having one piece
of data completely change your perspective can be exhilarating.
</p>

<p>
The real enemy of independent thinking is not any external authority, but
our own inertia. We need to find ways to counteract confirmation bias – our
tendency to take into account only information that confirms what we already
believe. We need to regularly confront our errors, mistakes, and
misunderstandings.
</p>

<p>
By taking notes on a wide variety of sources and in objective formats that
exist outside our heads, we practice the skill of seeing what is really
there and describing it plainfully and factually. By saving ideas that
aren’t compatible with each other and don’t necessarily support what we
already think, we train ourselves to develop subtle theories over time
instead of immediately jumping to conclusions.
</p>

<p>
By playing with a concept, stretching and reconceiving and remixing it, we
become less attached to how it was originally presented. We can extract
certain aspects or details for our own uses. With so many ideas at our
disposal, we are no longer threatened by the possibility that a new idea
will undermine existing ones.  Don’t just feel smarter. Become smarter.
</p>

<p>
Working with a slip-box can be disheartening, because you are constantly
faced with the gaps in your understanding. But at the same time, it
increases the chances that you will actually move the work forward.
</p>

<p>
Our choice then is whether we want to feel smarter or become smarter.
</p>

<p>
Students in most educational institutions are not encouraged to
independently build a network of connections between different kinds of
information. They aren’t taught how to organize the very best and most
relevant knowledge they encounter in a long-term way across many
topics. Most tragically of all, they aren’t taught to follow their interests
and take the most promising path in their research.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, learning should not be about hoarding stockpiles of knowledge
like gold coins. It is about becoming a different kind of person with a
different way of thinking. The beauty of this approach is that we co-evolve
with our slip-boxes: We build the same connections in our heads as we
deliberately develop them in our slip-box. Writing then is best seen not
only as a tool for thinking but as a tool for personal growth.  The 8 Steps
of Taking Smart Notes
</p>

<p>
Ahrens recommends the following 8 steps for taking notes:
</p>

<p>
Make fleeting notes Make literature notes Make permanent notes Now add
your new permanent notes to the slip-box Develop your topics, questions
and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box Decide on a
topic to write about from within the slip-box Turn your notes into a
rough draft Edit and proofread your manuscript
</p>

<p>
He notes that Luhmann actually had two slip-boxes: the first was the
“bibliographical” slip-box, which contained brief notes on the content of
the literature he read along with a citation of the source; the second
“main” slip-box contained the ideas and theories he developed based on those
sources. Both were wooden boxes containing paper index cards.
</p>

<p>
Luhmann distinguished between three kinds of notes that went into his
slip-boxes: fleeting notes, literature notes, and permanent notes.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make fleeting notes</li>
</ol>

<p>
Fleeting notes are quick, informal notes on any thought or idea that pops
into your mind. They don’t need to be highly organized, and in fact
shouldn’t be. They are not meant to capture an idea in full detail, but
serve more as reminders of what is in your head.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make literature notes</li>
</ol>

<p>
The second type of note is known as a “literature note.” As he read, Luhmann
would write down on index cards the main points he didn’t want to forget or
that he thought he could use in his own writing, with the bibliographic
details on the back.
</p>

<p>
Ahrens offers four guidelines in creating literature notes:
</p>

<p>
Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep Keep the overall note
as short as possible Use your own words, instead of copying quotes
verbatim Write down the bibliographic details on the source
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make permanent notes</li>
</ol>

<p>
Permanent notes are the third type of note, and make up the long-term
knowledge that give the slip-box its value.
</p>

<p>
This step starts with looking through the first two kinds of notes that
you’ve created: fleeting notes and literature notes. Ahrens recommends doing
this about once a day, before you completely forget what they contain.
</p>

<p>
As you go through them, think about how they relate to your research,
current thinking, or interests. The goal is not just to collect ideas, but
to develop arguments and discussions over time. If you need help jogging
your memory, simply look at the existing topics in your slip-box, since it
already contains only things that interest you.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few questions to ask yourself as you turn fleeting and literature
notes into permanent notes:
</p>

<p>
How does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to
what I already know?  How can I combine ideas to generate something new?
What questions are triggered by these new ideas?
</p>

<p>
As answers to these questions come to mind, write down each new idea,
comment, or thought on its own note. If writing on paper, only write on one
side, so you can quickly review your notes without having to flip them over.
</p>

<p>
Write these permanent notes as if you are writing for someone else. That is,
use full sentences, disclose your sources, make explicit references, and try
to be as precise and brief as possible.
</p>

<p>
Once this step is done, throw away (or delete) the fleeting notes from step
one and file the literature notes from step two into your bibliographic
slip-box.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Add your permanent notes to the slip-box</li>
</ol>

<p>
It’s now time to add the permanent notes you’ve created to your slip-box. Do
this by filing each note behind a related note (if it doesn’t relate to any
existing notes, add it to the very end).
</p>

<p>
Optionally, you can also:
</p>

<p>
Add links to (and from) related notes Adding it to an “index” – a
special kind of note that serves as a “table of contents” and entry
point for an important topic, including a sorted collection of links on
the topic
</p>

<p>
Each of the above methods is a way of creating an internal pathway through
your slip-box. Like hyperlinks on a website, they give you many ways to
associate ideas with each other. By following the links, you encounter new
and different perspectives than where you started.
</p>

<p>
Luhmann wrote his notes with great care, not much different from his style
in the final manuscript. More often than not, new notes would become part of
existing strands of thought. He would add links to other notes both close
by, and in distantly related fields. Rarely would a note stay in isolation.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Develop your topics, questions, and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box</li>
</ol>

<p>
With so many standardized notes organized in a consistent format, you are
now free to develop ideas in a “bottom up” way. See what is there, what is
missing, and which questions arise. Look for gaps that you can fill through
further reading.
</p>

<p>
If and when needed, another special kind of note you can create is an
“overview” note. These notes provide a “bird’s eye view” of a topic that has
already been developed to such an extent that a big picture view is
needed. Overview notes help to structure your thoughts and can be seen as an
in-between step in the development of a manuscript.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box</li>
</ol>

<p>
Instead of coming up with a topic or thesis upfront, you can just look into
your slip-box and look for what is most interesting. Your writing will be
based on what you already have, not on an unfounded guess about what the
literature you are about to read might contain. Follow the connections
between notes and collect all the relevant notes on the topic you’ve found.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Turn your notes into a rough draft</li>
</ol>

<p>
Don’t simply copy your notes into a manuscript. Translate them into
something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument. As you
detect holes in your argument, fill them or change the argument.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Edit and proofread your manuscript</li>
</ol>

<p>
From this point forward, all you have to do is refine your rough draft until
it’s ready to be published.
</p>

<p>
This process of creating notes and making connections shouldn’t be seen as
merely maintenance. The search for meaningful connections is a crucial part
of the thinking process. Instead of figuratively searching our memories, we
literally go through the slip-box and form concrete links. By working with
actual notes, we ensure that our thinking is rooted in a network of facts,
thought-through ideas, and verifiable references.
