<p>
Take notes in <a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html">slip-box</a> and make new connections will give us a chance to
refind the forgotten ideas.
</p>

<p>
Transferring ideas into the external memory slso allows us to forget them.
</p>

<p>
<a href="20200621182624-learning.html">Learning</a> would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk,
but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information to
circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. It is about making
sure that the right "cues" trigger the right memory, about how we can think
strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.
</p>

<p>
Useful <a href="20200621182624-learning.html">Learning</a> is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful
contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the
<a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html">slip-box</a> with other notes. Making these connections deliberately means
building up a self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that
work reciprocally as cues for each other.
</p>

<p>
Learned right, which means understanding, which means connecting in a
meaningful way to previous knowledge, information almost cannot be forgotten
anymore and will be reliably retrieved if triggered by the right cues.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html">slip-box</a> forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: <b>What does it
mean? How does it connect to &#x2026; ? What is the difference between &#x2026; ? What
is it similar to?</b>
</p>

<p>
举一反三。
</p>

<p>
<b>Elaborating on the differences and similarities of notes instead of sorting
them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to
categorise and create sensible classifications.</b>
