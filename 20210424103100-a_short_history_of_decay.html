<p>
History is nothing but a procession of false Absolutes, a series of temples
raised to pretexts, a degradation of the mind before the Improbable.
</p>

<p>
Everyone trying to remedy everyone's life: even beggars, even the incurable
aspire to it: the sidewalks and hospitals of the world overflow with
reformers. The longing to become a source of events affects each man like
mental disorder or a desired malediction. Society&#x2013;an inferno of saviors!
What Diogenes was looking for with his lantern was an indifferent man&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Every faith practices some form of terror, all the more dreadful when the
"pure" are its agents.
</p>

<p>
The compulsion to preach is so rooted in us that it emerges from depths
unknown to the instinct for self-preservation. Each of us awaits his moment
in order to propose something&#x2013;anything. He has a voice: that is enough. It
costs us dear to be neither deaf nor dumb&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The source of our actions resides in an unconscious propensity to regard
ourselves as the center, the cause, and the conclusion of time.
</p>

<p>
To live is to blind ourselves to our own dimensions.
