<p>
Taking liberature notes is a form of deliberate practice as it give us
feedback on our understanding or lack of it, while the effort to put into
our own words the gist of something is at the same time the best approach to
understanding what we read.
</p>

<p>
Do they still make sense in writing?
</p>

<p>
Are we even able to get the thought on paper?
</p>

<p>
<b>Do we have the references, facts and supporting sources at hand?</b>
</p>

<p>
References, facts and supporting sources, where are they from? Make them
from the <a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html#ID-D43B97E9-30A7-47BA-8DDE-E9FEC5FD78D3">slip-box</a>.
</p>

<p>
The brain alone is too eager to make us feel good - even if it is by
politely ignoring inconsistencies in our <a href="20200729091540-thinking.html#ID-EF861195-938E-40E0-BCEE-739FA4398539">Thinking</a>. Only in the written form
can an argument be looked at with a certain distance - literally.
</p>

<p>
We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve
information.
</p>

<p>
The brain, as kahneman writes, is "a machine for jumping to conclusions".
And a machine that is designed for jumping to conclusions is not the kind of
machine you want to rely on when it comes to facts and rationality - at
least, you would want to conterbalance it. Luhmann states as clearly as
possible: <b>it is not possible to think systematically without <a href="20200725160657-行文.html#ID-38D8E3B5-8907-4BF0-84D2-E7DA9C46B9C8">Writing</a></b>.

</p>

<p>
"Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [&#x2026;] do not make contemporary
physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it
possible" is one of the key takeaways in a contemporary handbook of
neuroscientist (Levy 2011, 290).

<p>
<b>What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about
in my <a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html#ID-D43B97E9-30A7-47BA-8DDE-E9FEC5FD78D3">slip-box</a>?</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?</b>
</p>

<p>
By explicitly writing down how something connects or leads to something
else, we force ourselves to clarify and distinguish ideas from each other.
