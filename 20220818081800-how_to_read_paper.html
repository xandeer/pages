<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Get a bird's-eye view.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Carefully read the title, abstract and introduction</li>
<li>Read the section and sub-section headings, but ignore everything else</li>
<li>Read the conclusion</li>
<li>Glace over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you've already read</li>
</ol>

<p>
After first pass, you should know 5Cs:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Category</i>: Measurement? Analysics of an existing system? A description of a reseach prototype?</li>
<li><i>Context</i>: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?</li>
<li><i>Correctness</i>: Do the assumptions appear to be valid</li>
<li><i>Contributions</i>: What are the paper's main contributions?</li>
<li><i>Clarity</i>: Is the paper well written?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next: Choose whether to read further.

<h3 id="orgfa709d1"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Second pass</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Ignore details such as proofs. Jot down the key points as you read.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.</li>
<li>Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading (this is a good way to learn more about the background of the paper).</li>
</ol>

<p>
After the second pass, you should be able to:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>grasp the content of the paper</li>
<li>summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else</li>
</ol>

<p>
This level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested, but does not lie in your research speciality.
</p>

<p>
Next:
a. set the paper aside, hoping you don't need to understand the material to be successful in your career
b. return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material
c. persevere and go on to the third pass

<h3 id="org7a5d8d8"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Third pass</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The key to the third pass is to attemp to <i>virtually re-implement</i> the paper: that is, making the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. By comparing this re-creation with the actual paper, you can easily identify not only a paper's innovations, but also its hidden failings and assumptions.
</p>

<p>
You should identify and chanllenge every assumption in every statement. Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work.
</p>

<p>
At the end of this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its strong and weak points. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.
