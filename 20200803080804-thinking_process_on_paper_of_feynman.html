<a href="20200731090714-feynman.html">Richard Feynman</a> once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to
interview him. When he spotted <a href="20200731090714-feynman.html">Feynman</a>'s notebooks, he said how delighted he
was to see such "wonderful records of Feynman's <a href="20200729091540-thinking.html">Thinking</a>."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" <a href="20200731090714-feynman.html">Feynman</a> protested. "They aren't a record of my <a href="20200729091540-thinking.html">Thinking</a> process.
They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper."
</p>

<p>
"Well," the historian said, "the work was done in your head, but the record
of it is still here."
</p>

<p>
"No, it's not a record, not really. It's working. You have to work on paper,
and this is the paper."
