We are usually not even aware of this <a href="20200621175518-confirmation_bias.html#ID-C121D1A0-2EDA-4B52-992D-C054E0C58753">Confirmation Bias</a> (or myside bias).
Somehow, we just seem to happen to be surrounded by people who all think
alike. (Not on purpose, of course. We just spend our time with people we
like. And why do we like them? Correct: Because they think like us.) We just
seem to happen to read the publications that tend to confirm what we already
know. (Not on purpose, of course. We just try to stick with good,
intelligent texts. And what makes us think these texts are good and
intelligent? Correct: because they make sense to us.) We look around and
just cut out dis-confirming facts without even noticing what we don't see,
very much like the same city can one day be full of happy people and the
other day full of miserable ones, depending on our mood.

The <a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html#ID-D43B97E9-30A7-47BA-8DDE-E9FEC5FD78D3">slip-box</a> is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers
revelant notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting
thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw
conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.
