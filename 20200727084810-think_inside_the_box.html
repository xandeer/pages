<p>
To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their
original context by means of abstraction and re-specification.
</p>

<p>
If the story of Romeo and Juliet touches us, it is certainly not because we
are all members of one of two feuding families in Verona. We abstract from
time and place, from the particular circumstances until we can meet the
protagonists of this story on a general level where our own emotional life
can <a href="20200723210238-resonant.html">resonant</a> with what we see on stage.
</p>

<p>
Usually, we don't even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to
make it fit its expectations. We need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the
power of thinking routines.
</p>

<p>
Make sure that you really see what you think you see and describe it as
plainly and factually as possible.
</p>

<p>
It is very good to know what has already proven to not work if we try to
come up with new ideas that do work.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, it is more important to rediscover the problems for which we
already have a solution than to think solely about the problems that are
present to us.
</p>

<p>
What kind of answer can you expect from asking a question in this particular
way? What is missing?
</p>

<p>
<b>Taking simple ideas seriously.</b> Consider, for example, the idea of buying
stocks low and selling them high. I am sure everyone can grasp that idea.
But grasping an idea is not the same as understanding it. If you go and buy
stocks on that "insight," all you can do is to hope that a stock goes up
after you buy it, which makes this knowledge about as useful as the tip on
the next colour to choose on a roulette table.
</p>

<p>
The next level of understanding is reached when you realise what you buy if
you buy a stock: a part of a company. The only thing Warren Buffett thinks
about it is the relationship between price and value - he doesn't even look
at the price from yesterday. He understands that simple is not the same as
easy, and that the worst thing you can do is to make a simple task
unnecessarily complicated. A stock is a share in a company. The price is set
by the market, which means by supply and demand, which touches on the
rationality of market participants as well as the question of valuation,
which means you have to understand something about the business you are
considering investing in, including competition, competitive advantages,
technological developments, etc.
</p>

<p>
Making things more complicated than they are can be a way to avoid the
underlying complexity of simple ideas. This is what happened during the
financial crisis of 2008: Economists developed hugely complicated products,
but did not take into account the simple fact that <b>price and value are not
necessarily the same</b>. There is a reason why Buffett is not only a great
investor, but also a great teacher: He not only has a vast knowledge about
everything related to business, he can also explain it all in simple terms.
</p>

<p>
By using the <a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html">slip-box</a> on a daily basis, we train these important
intellectual skills deliberately: We check if what we understood from a text
is really in the text by having our understanding in written form in front
of our eyes. We learn to focus on the gist of an idea by restricting
ourselves in terms of space. We can make it a habit to always think about
what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking
good questions when we sort our notes into the <a href="20200621182705-slip_box.html">slip-box</a> and connect them
with other notes.
</p>

<p>
Only by abstraction and re-specification can we apply ideas in the singular
and always differrent situations in reality.
