Ahrens recommends the following 8 steps for taking notes:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Make fleeting notes</li>
<li>Make literature notes</li>
<li>Make permanent notes</li>
<li>Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box</li>
<li>Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from
within the slip-box</li>
<li>Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box</li>
<li>Turn your notes into a rough draft</li>
<li>Edit and proofread your manuscript</li>
</ol>

<p>
He notes that Luhmann actually had two slip-boxes: the first was the
“bibliographical” slip-box, which contained brief notes on the content of
the literature he read along with a citation of the source; the second
“main” slip-box contained the ideas and theories he developed based on those
sources. Both were wooden boxes containing paper index cards.
</p>

<p>
Luhmann distinguished between three kinds of notes that went into his
slip-boxes: fleeting notes, literature notes, and permanent notes.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orgebfaf9a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgebfaf9a"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Make fleeting notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Fleeting notes are quick, informal notes on any thought or idea that pops
into your mind. They don’t need to be highly organized, and in fact
shouldn’t be. They are not meant to capture an idea in full detail, but
serve more as reminders of what is in your head.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6942b5c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6942b5c"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Make literature notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The second type of note is known as a “literature note.” As he read, Luhmann
would write down on index cards the main points he didn’t want to forget or
that he thought he could use in his own writing, with the bibliographic
details on the back.
</p>

<p>
Ahrens offers four guidelines in creating literature notes:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be extremely selective in what you decide to keep</li>
<li>Keep the overall note as short as possible</li>
<li>Use your own words, instead of copying quotes verbatim</li>
<li>Write down the bibliographic details on the source</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org58f4255" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org58f4255"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Make permanent notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Permanent notes are the third type of note, and make up the long-term
knowledge that give the slip-box its value.
</p>

<p>
This step starts with looking through the first two kinds of notes that
you’ve created: fleeting notes and literature notes. Ahrens recommends doing
this about once a day, before you completely forget what they contain.
</p>

<p>
As you go through them, think about how they relate to your research,
current thinking, or interests. The goal is not just to collect ideas, but
to develop arguments and discussions over time. If you need help jogging
your memory, simply look at the existing topics in your slip-box, since it
already contains only things that interest you.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few questions to ask yourself as you turn fleeting and literature
notes into permanent notes:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>How does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what
I already know?</li>
<li>How can I combine ideas to generate something new?</li>
<li>What questions are triggered by these new ideas?</li>
</ol>

<p>
As answers to these questions come to mind, write down each new idea,
comment, or thought on its own note. If writing on paper, only write on one
side, so you can quickly review your notes without having to flip them over.
</p>

<p>
Write these permanent notes as if you are writing for someone else. That is,
use full sentences, disclose your sources, make explicit references, and try
to be as precise and brief as possible.
</p>

<p>
Once this step is done, throw away (or delete) the fleeting notes from step
one and file the literature notes from step two into your bibliographic
slip-box.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgdcfdd4a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdcfdd4a"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Add your permanent notes to the slip-box</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
It’s now time to add the permanent notes you’ve created to your slip-box. Do
this by filing each note behind a related note (if it doesn’t relate to any
existing notes, add it to the very end).
</p>

<p>
Optionally, you can also:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Add links to (and from) related notes</li>
<li>Adding it to an “index” – a special kind of note that serves as a “table
of contents” and entry point for an important topic, including a sorted
collection of links on the topic</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each of the above methods is a way of creating an internal pathway through
your slip-box. Like hyperlinks on a website, they give you many ways to
associate ideas with each other. By following the links, you encounter new
and different perspectives than where you started.
</p>

<p>
Luhmann wrote his notes with great care, not much different from his style
in the final manuscript. More often than not, new notes would become part of
existing strands of thought. He would add links to other notes both close
by, and in distantly related fields. Rarely would a note stay in isolation.

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org899bb37" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org899bb37"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Develop your topics, questions, and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
With so many standardized notes organized in a consistent format, you are
now free to develop ideas in a “bottom up” way. See what is there, what is
missing, and which questions arise. Look for gaps that you can fill through
further reading.
</p>

<p>
If and when needed, another special kind of note you can create is an
“overview” note. These notes provide a “bird’s eye view” of a topic that has
already been developed to such an extent that a big picture view is needed.
Overview notes help to structure your thoughts and can be seen as an
in-between step in the development of a manuscript.

<div id="outline-container-org318e52e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org318e52e"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Instead of coming up with a topic or thesis upfront, you can just look into
your slip-box and look for what is most interesting. Your writing will be
based on what you already have, not on an unfounded guess about what the
literature you are about to read might contain. Follow the connections
between notes and collect all the relevant notes on the topic you’ve found.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org10f03aa" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org10f03aa"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Turn your notes into a rough draft</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Don’t simply copy your notes into a manuscript. Translate them into
something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument. As you
detect holes in your argument, fill them or change the argument.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org84273e7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org84273e7"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Edit and proofread your manuscript</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
From this point forward, all you have to do is refine your rough draft until
it’s ready to be published.
</p>

<p>
This process of creating notes and making connections shouldn’t be seen as
merely maintenance. The search for meaningful connections is a crucial part
of the thinking process. Instead of figuratively searching our memories, we
literally go through the slip-box and form concrete links. By working with
actual notes, we ensure that our thinking is rooted in a network of facts,
thought-through ideas, and verifiable references.
